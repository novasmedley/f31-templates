\section*{Selection of Sponsor and Institution [1 pg]}
\textbf{Describe the rationale/justification for the selection of both the sponsor and the institution.}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Explain why the sponsor, co-sponsor (if any), and institution were selected to accomplish
	the research training goals. If the proposed research training is to take place at a site
	other than the applicant organization, provide an explanation here.
	\item Foreign Institution. If you are proposing a research training experience at a foreign
	institution, describe how that the foreign institution and sponsor offer special
	opportunities for training that are not currently available in the United States. Key
	factors in the selection of a foreign institution should be described. The need for and
	level of proficiency in reading, speaking, and comprehending the foreign language
	should be addressed.
	\item Postdoctoral and Senior Fellowship Applicants requesting training at their
	Doctorate or Current Institution: Training is expected to broaden a fellow's perspective.
	Therefore, if you are requesting training at either your doctorate institution or any
	institution where you have been training for more than a year, you must explain why
	further training at that institution would be valuable. Individuals applying for senior
	fellowships who are requesting training at the institution at which they are employed
	should provide a similar explanation.
